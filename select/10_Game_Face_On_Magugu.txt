Got the game on smash on lock Dedication prepared no need luck
Got my 10 toes grinding on the concrete I go show dem na me run the block
Run dem run dem oga man boss
See Dem times I run to catch bus
See dem times I beg dem for favours when I no get no food for my pot
Table don turn
Now dey beg friend but the bridge don burn Get my game on
Go beast mode on dem like the one
Dey go no say no be play play I do tings my way
Dey go know say hard work and dedication dey pay Game face on
game face game face on (I’m here to catch fun) Game face on game face game face on
(Make dem bring it on)
If I fall down I go rise again If I fall down I go rise again If I fall down I go rise again Game face game face on
The battle is won but the war goes on
Paid the cost to be the big don
Dey go know say kakhi no be leather when I jam dem naija where I’m from
Game face game face on
Shut down the shop just put the mic on
Dey go know say dis one no be small boy do the damn thing the thing nothing long
