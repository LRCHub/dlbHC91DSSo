Sail on savior, I can't take no more of your insanity in wisdom
Satisfy your angels with your Cocaine and your guns
As for me, I don't need them

When my shadow comes alive
And wrestles with my soul
Oh, do you really want to know?

Savior, you can be what you want to be
Oh yea, only see what you want to see
Sail on, I can't let you get next to me

Well to be at one with your weakness
Is your greatest strength
Yea you should be proud 'cause you can't guess

Guess it always was your hallelujah
Yes it was your saving grace

Savior, you can be what you want to be
Oh yea, only see what you want to see
Sail on, I can't let you get next to me

Say what you want now
My eyes are open wide
How was I ever on your side?

Savior, you can be what you want to be
Oh yea, only see what you want to see
Oh yea sail on, I can't let you get next to me
Savior
