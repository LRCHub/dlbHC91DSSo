Don't give meeh an inch
Cuz i'll take it all now
Another style for you to hate
I sat up today, my style in the straight
And if you care to relate

No, you can't copy meeh
Cuz i been changed
Stay in your lane
Remain with the straight
Don't cross that line
You goin' out of your mind
I got that grind so don't you hate meeh

You can judge meeh wrong
Don't leave, home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
See my head is strong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Gotta keep it on

Try to play meeh wrong
Never forget you've got a game face on
Got it goin' on
When i wrote this song
Say it in the mirror with my game face on
Got it goin' on

Got it keep it on
Stay true to the bone, freak of the moan
So where they goin'
Gotta be in the zone
No chaperones, no earphone
It's time to get it on

I don't know what you all be on
But got to be strong
I'm about ready to move on
Like fidel castro or al capone, jodeci
Everybody wants to go

You can judge meeh wrong
Don't leave, home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
See my head is strong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Gotta keep it on

Got my game face on
Got my game face on, gentlemen
Steady, yeah

You can judge meeh wrong
Don't leave, home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
See my head is strong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Gotta keep it on

I got my game face on
You better walk a straight line
